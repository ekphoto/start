## Summary

WordPress Starter Theme for use as Child Theme of the Genesis Framework for building custom themes, using Compass/SCSS and Grunt. Tested with WordPress 3.6 and Genesis 2.0.0.
Modifying to fit my requirements - still a lot of Matt code in project ( Thanks for all the hard work.


The following is all from Matt:

## Usage

The theme is setup to use [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to compile Compass/SCSS, lint, concatenate and minify JavaScript (with source maps), optimize images, and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) the browser (with extension), with flexibility to add any additional tasks via the Gruntfile. Alternatively, you can use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) or whatever else you prefer to compile the SCSS and manage the JavaScript.

Rename folder to your theme name, change the `assets/scss/style.scss` intro block to your theme information. Open the theme directory in terminal and run `npm install` to pull in all Grunt dependencies. Run `grunt` to execute tasks. Code as you will. If you have the LiveReload browser extension, it will reload after any SCSS or JS changes. To optimize images, run `grunt imagemin`.

- Compile `assets/scss/style.scss` to `style.css` (all paths defined in config.rb for Compass)
- Compile `assets/scss/editor-style.scss` to `editor-style.css`
- Concatenate and minify plugins in `assets/js/vender` and `assets/js/source/plugins.js` to `assets/js/plugins.min.js`
- Minify `assets/js/source/main.js` to `assets/js/main.min.js`
- ??
- Profit

To concatenate and minify your jQuery plugins, add them to the `assets/js/vendor` directory and add the `js` filename and path to the `Gruntfile` `uglify` task. Previous versions of the starter theme automatically pulled all plugins in the `vendor` directory, but this has changed to allow more granular control and for managing plugins and assets with bower.

### Bower

Supports [bower](https://github.com/bower/bower) to install and manage JavaScript dependencies in the `assets/js/vendor` folder.

### Deployment

The theme includes deployments via [grunt-rsync](https://github.com/jedrichards/grunt-rsync). The Gruntfile includes setups for staging and production - edit your paths and host, then run `grunt rsync:staging` or `grunt rsync:production` to deploy your files via rsync.

### Features

1. Compass & SCSS with easy-to-use of mixins ready to go
2. Easy to customize
3. Grunt and LiveReload to make it more gooder
4. Child theme tweaks
5. More to come!
